I'm a Postdoc at the University of Oxford in the [Human Information Processing Lab](https://humaninformationprocessing.com/). I defended my PHD in September 2024, which looked at the [neural and psychological mechanisms supporting persistence with goals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01844-5). At the moment, I'm working on projects which compare how humans and artificial agents learn multiple tasks. I'm especially interested in the [trade-offs between knowledge transfer and interference] (https://2023.ccneuro.website/proceedings/0001124.pdf?s=W&pn=1595).

I'm a Postdoc at the University of Oxford in the [Human Information Processing Lab](https://humaninformationprocessing.com/). I defended my PHD in September 2024. During my PhD, I studied mechanisms supporting persistence with goals [(published here)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01844-5) and planning [(preprint here)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/y8xqr/). My research uses computational models of behaviour and fMRI to explore these mechanisms in healthy people and individuals with prefrontal brain damage. At the moment, I'm working on projects which compare how humans and artificial agents learn multiple tasks. I'm especially interested in the trade-offs between knowledge transfer and interference, described [here](https://2023.ccneuro.website/proceedings/0001124.pdf?s=W&pn=1595).
